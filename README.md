# Landig_page
Task 1 - Create and Deploy a Landing Page This is a simple HTML page for a Wallpaper Gallery that allows users to view and download high-quality wallpapers categorized by themes like Cities, Nature, Mountains, Beaches, Animals, etc.

Key features: Categories: The gallery offers different categories like "Cities," "Nature," "Wallpapers," etc., each with a random image from that category.

Download Option: Each image has a "Save Image" button, which lets users download the wallpaper by clicking it.

Responsive Design: The page is structured to work well on both mobile and desktop devices.

Image Resolution: The images are displayed in a high resolution (2200x1320), making them look crisp and clear.

"Next" Button: Each category has a "Next" button (though it doesn't lead to a new page in this example).

Itâ€™s a simple, clean, and easy-to-navigate gallery that can be used to showcase wallpapers from different categories and allow users to download them with ease.
